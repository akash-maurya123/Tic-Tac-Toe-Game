🧩 About the Project

This is a Tic Tac Toe Game built using React (Vite) — a fun, lightweight, and interactive web-based game where two players (X and O) take turns marking spaces on a 3×3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

The project demonstrates the use of React hooks, state management, and responsive UI design while keeping the interface minimal and engaging.
